**How To Play**

1: Each round, the game will play a sequence of lights and sounds that will increase in length with each successful attempt.
Listen carefully to the sounds associated with each button as they light up.

2: The player will then attempt to repeat the sequence using the mouse to click on the buttons in the same order as presented

3: If the player correctly repeats the sequence, the score is increased by 1 and the game continues.

4: Otherwise the score is reduced to 0 and the user is prompted to either quit the game or reset it
